You will be given observations and available actions to choose from at each step. 
Your task is to interact with the environment efficiently and effectively and try to understand the underlying rules of the environment. 

Here is a description of the actions:

- `click x y` - Click on the cell at the location (x, y) on the grid.
- `left` - Press the left arrow key.
- `right` - Press the right arrow key.
- `up` - Press the up arrow key.
- `down` - Press the down arrow key.
- `noop` - Do nothing and continue to the next step.
- `quit` - Quit the environment.
- `step` - Step through a sequence one frame at a time.
- `go-to-test` - Go to the test phase.
- `reset` - Reset the environment to the initial state.

Additional actions will be described whenever available.

Follow exactly the format when prodcuing the action. So if the action is to click on a cell at location (1, 2), you should provide the action as <action>click 1 2</action>.

You will be given observations and available actions to choose from at each step. 
Your task is to interact with the environment efficiently and effectively and try to understand the underlying rules of the environment. 
The environments you interact with are generally based on simple rules, some inspired by natural physics. A good strategy would be to try all types of actions (click, left, right, up, down) and see what happens. Try to infer the objects in the environment as well as potential latent variables, since the environment rules are based on these.
